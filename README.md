## üìÇ **Projects**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Urban Crime & Green Space Analysis**  
- **Description:** Analyzed the impact of green space on crime rates in Baltimore using **spatiotemporal modeling (R-INLA, ZIP models)**.  
- **Key Tools:** R, Python, ArcGIS  
- **Impact:** Found a **66.6% reduction in violent crime** due to urban greening policies.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Predicting Health Risks with AI**  
- **Description:** Built **ML models (Random Forest, Clustering, Regression)** to analyze **1M+ neighborhood data points** for public health risk stratification.  
- **Key Tools:** Python, R, SQL, Power BI  
- **Impact:** Identified **top 20% vulnerable areas** facing **50% higher healthcare disparities** and **30% more environmental risks**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Clinical Effectiveness and Safety of Dupilumab in COPD: A 7-Year Population-Based Cohort Study**  
- **Description:** Investigated the effectiveness of **Dupilumab** for treating **COPD** using electronic health records from **TriNetX**.  
- **Key Tools:** R  
- **Impact:** Conducted a **retrospective cohort study** using **Cox proportional hazards models with propensity score matching**, demonstrating that **Dupilumab reduces all-cause mortality, acute exacerbations, and pneumonia risk** in COPD patients, supporting its **FDA approval**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Assessing Health and Economic Benefits of Air Pollution Reduction Policies in Taiwan**  
- **Description:** Integrated **township-level PM2.5 data** into broader **county and city-level exposure metrics** using a **population-weighted approach**, assessing attributable disease burden **(2000-2015)** through **random sampling based on the normal distribution of relative risks**.  
- **Key Tools:** R, SAS  
- **Impact:** Developed **epidemiological models using 23 million electronic health records** to quantify **air pollution‚Äôs impact on disease burden and healthcare costs**, projecting **$3.67 billion in potential savings** and **3.19 million avoidable DALYs** under improved air quality scenarios.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **The Hydrological Characteristics of Hehuan Mountain Watershed and Impact Assessment of Climate Variation**  
- **Description:** Applied the **SWAT-MODFLOW model** in **ArcGIS** to **simulate interactions between surface water and groundwater**.  
- **Key Tools:** MATLAB, ArcGIS  
- **Impact:** Demonstrated **groundwater as a stable buffer resource** through hydrological modeling, leading to a **successful recommendation for Taiwan‚Äôs Water Resources Agency** to develop **groundwater reservoirs for water resource security**.
